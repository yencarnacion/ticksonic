I have the python program below that connects to polygon.io api.  The current cost of the polygon api for business is $1999/mo.  I am looking for lower cost high quality alternatives.  I am considering using instead real time market data via the interactive brokers ib gateway api.  Another alternative is https://iqhelp.dtn.com/core-service-fees/.  I only need real time time and sales data plus best bid and ask data from stocks trading on nasdaq, nyse, and amex

What should I consider?  What should i be aware of?  What alternatives do you suggest?  What do you suggest?

Below is a detailed analysis of what to consider when looking for a lower‐cost, high‐quality alternative to Polygon.io for real‐time time & sales and top-of‐book (best bid/ask) data on NASDAQ, NYSE, and AMEX.

---

### Key Considerations

• **Data Quality & Coverage:**  
  Make sure the alternative reliably delivers the types of messages you need (trade prints and top-of‐book quotes) from the specific exchanges you care about. Note that some providers (like IBKR’s free feeds) may offer non‑consolidated data while others (like Polygon or DTN IQFeed) provide NBBO or consolidated quotes.

• **Latency & Reliability:**  
  For real‑time trading or analysis, low latency is critical. Evaluate how quickly the provider can deliver data and whether it supports high-frequency streaming via WebSocket or other efficient protocols.

• **Cost Structure & Subscription Fees:**  
  Compare the base monthly fees plus any additional exchange or connectivity fees. For example, while Polygon’s business plan is around $1999/month, IBKR (if you already have an account) may offer free streaming for US stocks (albeit non‑consolidated) or low‑cost consolidated data subscriptions. IQFeed’s core service fee is around $99/month (plus exchange fees), which might be attractive if you don’t need the entire suite of extra endpoints.

• **Integration & API Ease of Use:**  
  Switching from Polygon’s API to another platform may require adapting your code. IB’s Gateway API (used with IBKR Pro) is robust but can be less straightforward than a REST/WebSocket API like Polygon’s. IQFeed, on the other hand, has its own SDKs and libraries that many algorithmic traders appreciate.

• **Account Requirements & Operational Considerations:**  
  With IBKR, you must have an active, funded account and subscribe to the necessary market data feeds. Consider whether non‑consolidated data meets your needs or if you require a subscription for NBBO. Similarly, some data providers may require you to classify your account as non‑professional to benefit from lower fees.

### Alternative Providers

1. **Interactive Brokers (IB) Gateway API:**  
   – **Pros:**  
 • If you already have an IB account, you may access free real‑time streaming for US-listed stocks/ETFs from providers such as Cboe One and IEX (typically non‑consolidated).  
 • Low commissions and robust, enterprise-grade connectivity.  
   – **Considerations:**  
 • IB’s API can be more cumbersome to integrate compared to Polygon’s simple WebSocket client.  
 • For consolidated (NBBO) data or full bid/ask quotes, you might need to subscribe to additional feeds, which could incur extra fees.  
 • Ensure that the data latency and quality meet your application’s requirements.

2. **DTN IQFeed:**  
   – **Pros:**  
 • Offers a dedicated real‑time market data service with a core service fee of around $99/month (plus additional exchange fees for certain feeds), which can be much lower than $1999/month.  
 • Known for high‑quality, low‑latency trade and quote data and used by many professional traders.  
   – **Considerations:**  
 • Review the detailed exchange fee structure (see DTN’s [Core Service Fees](https://iqhelp.dtn.com/core-service-fees/) for specifics) to determine your actual cost for the exchanges you care about.  
 • Integration and support are typically robust, but you must verify that it provides exactly the “time & sales” and best bid/ask information you require.

3. **Other Alternatives (e.g., IEX Cloud or Alpaca):**  
   – These platforms often offer free or low‑cost real‑time data for US equities. However, verify that their data coverage (such as depth and consolidation) and API features match your needs.  
   – IEX Cloud, for example, is very developer‑friendly, though its focus is largely on IEX data and may not cover the full consolidated NBBO from all exchanges.

### My Suggestion

If you already trade via IB and your volume doesn’t require the full data suite that Polygon offers, then exploring the **IB Gateway API** might be the best starting point—especially if non‑consolidated data is acceptable for your purposes. On the other hand, if you need consolidated, professional‑grade data and want to keep costs low, then **DTN IQFeed** is a proven alternative with lower monthly fees (subject to exchange fee add‑ons).

Ultimately, you should:
  
• Confirm whether non‑consolidated data from IB meets your real‑time best bid/ask needs.  
• Compare the total cost (including any exchange fees) of IQFeed versus IB’s subscriptions.  
• Assess the integration effort—if your Python application is already built around Polygon’s model, switching to an IB or IQFeed API might require some refactoring.

### Final Thoughts

Both IBKR and IQFeed are industry‑proven platforms with lower costs relative to Polygon’s business plan. Your choice will depend on the balance between cost, ease of integration, data quality, and the specific features you require (consolidated quotes versus non‑consolidated). Make sure to review each provider’s documentation and trial their services if possible before fully committing.

Thanks for sharing your requirements! I will research cost-effective alternatives to Polygon.io that provide real-time time and sales data, plus best bid and ask data for Nasdaq, NYSE, and AMEX stocks. I'll focus on options under $600/month that match your latency expectations and symbol tracking needs, while also considering APIs that support historical data, candlestick charts, volume, and VWAP calculations.

I'll get back to you with a detailed comparison and recommendations.

# Alternatives to Polygon.io for Real‑Time Stock Data

Developers seeking real-time US stock market data (trades *and* best bid/ask quotes) have several cost-effective alternatives to Polygon.io. Below we compare notable options on pricing, data features (coverage and history), latency, API integration (especially with Python), and any limitations. All options support tracking ~1–10 symbols in real time and can facilitate volume-weighted average price (VWAP) calculations through trade data or aggregates.

## IQFeed by DTN
- **Pricing:** Approximately **$100–$130/month** for non-professional users (core service ~$99/mo plus exchange fees) ([Welcome BookMap XRay Customer to DTN IQFeed! - Fast, Reliable, Affordable.  Market Data and API's.](https://www.iqfeed.net/Bookmap/index.cfm?displayaction=data&section=fees#:~:text=Service%20Pricing%20Startup%20Fee%3A%20,Time%20Data)). This provides unlimited streaming for up to 500 symbols and access to all major U.S. equity exchanges (Nasdaq, NYSE, Amex, regional exchanges) in real time ([DTN IQFeed, DTN.IQ, DTN ProphetX Support Forums](https://forums.iqfeed.net/index.cfm?page=topic&topicID=5748#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20doing%20any,additional%20fee%20to%20view%20more)).
- **Data & Features:** **Tick-by-tick** streaming of trades (“time and sales”) and NBBO quotes is provided with high reliability and quality ([IQFeed vs Polygon.io | Elite Trader](https://www.elitetrader.com/et/threads/iqfeed-vs-polygon-io.320799/#:~:text=,ass%20to%20use%20and%20historical)). IQFeed’s data is consolidated from all exchanges, so you get the full market volume and true NBBO in real time. It also offers add-ons for options, futures, Level II order book, etc. if needed.
- **Historical Data:** **Extensive history** is included. Users can pull up to 180 days of tick-level data and over 10 years of intraday minute bars and daily bars ([DTN IQFeed, DTN.IQ, DTN ProphetX Support Forums](https://forums.iqfeed.net/index.cfm?page=topic&topicID=5748#:~:text=Yes%2C%20tick%20data%20generally%20goes,daily%20data%20goes%20back%20further)). This covers the user’s needs for 15-minute candles or last 60 minutes of intraday data with volume. (IQFeed can return historical intraday aggregates or you can build them from tick data.)
- **Latency:** **Low latency** feed suitable for most algorithmic trading needs. IQFeed is not colocated in NY4/Equinix like some institutional feeds, so its latency may be a few milliseconds higher than ultra-low-latency providers ([IQFeed vs Polygon.io | Elite Trader](https://www.elitetrader.com/et/threads/iqfeed-vs-polygon-io.320799/#:~:text=,kind%20of%20price%20than%20iqfeed)). For example, one user noted IQFeed’s ticker plant is in the U.S. Midwest, introducing slight delay relative to exchange colocation ([IQFeed vs Polygon.io | Elite Trader](https://www.elitetrader.com/et/threads/iqfeed-vs-polygon-io.320799/#:~:text=,kind%20of%20price%20than%20iqfeed)). In practice, it’s real-time for all but the most latency-sensitive (<1ms) strategies.
- **API Integration (Python):** Integration requires running the IQFeed client (Windows software, though it can run on Linux via Wine). The API is socket/TCP based. **Python support** is available through community libraries (e.g. `pyiqfeed`) or by using the API’s text protocol directly. Developers report the feed is **stable and reliable**, and the API is well-documented ([IQFeed vs Polygon.io | Elite Trader](https://www.elitetrader.com/et/threads/iqfeed-vs-polygon-io.320799/#:~:text=,)) ([IQFeed vs Polygon.io | Elite Trader](https://www.elitetrader.com/et/threads/iqfeed-vs-polygon-io.320799/#:~:text=,)). Some setup (managing the client connection) is needed, but many have automated it (even via Docker containers) with success ([IQFeed vs Polygon.io | Elite Trader](https://www.elitetrader.com/et/threads/iqfeed-vs-polygon-io.320799/#:~:text=,around%20the%20edges%20back%20then)).
- **Limitations:** IQFeed’s main drawbacks are the platform requirements and modest cost. It’s a **proprietary client** rather than simple REST/HTTP. You must sign **exchange agreements** (handled during signup) and ensure non-professional status for the lowest fees. The 500-streaming-symbol limit is plenty for 1–10 symbols, and can be raised for a fee if ever needed ([DTN IQFeed, DTN.IQ, DTN ProphetX Support Forums](https://forums.iqfeed.net/index.cfm?page=topic&topicID=5748#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20doing%20any,additional%20fee%20to%20view%20more)). Overall, IQFeed is a **high-quality retail data feed** known for accuracy and reliability, making it a top alternative to Polygon ([Polygon. io, Intrinio, Alpaca, or Xignite : r/quant](https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/1fjbzlv/polygon_io_intrinio_alpaca_or_xignite/#:~:text=has%20this%20problem,but%20it%20follows%20a%20pattern)).

## DataBento
- **Pricing:** **$199/month (flat)** for the **Standard** plan ([Upcoming changes to pricing plans in January 2025 | Databento Blog](https://databento.com/blog/upcoming-changes-to-pricing-plans-in-january-2025#:~:text=,Plus%20and%20Unlimited%20for%20clarity)), which includes unlimited real-time data and **no per-call fees**. This price is within the user’s budget and is intended to be a cost-effective option bridging retail and enterprise needs ([Upcoming changes to pricing plans in January 2025 | Databento Blog](https://databento.com/blog/upcoming-changes-to-pricing-plans-in-january-2025#:~:text=Our%20revamped%20subscription%20plans%20are,designed%20to%20offer%20greater%20flexibility)). (Non-professional exchange fees may be extra, but those are typically very low – on the order of $1–$3 per exchange.)
- **Data & Features:** **Institutional-grade full-market feed.** DataBento’s new equities service (launched in 2025) provides real-time trades and quotes from **all major U.S. exchanges and alternative trading systems (ATS)** – in total, around 40 venues ([Databento on Instagram: "We're trying to raise the bar in our industry ...](https://www.instagram.com/databento/p/DF75lO_tuON/#:~:text=Databento%20on%20Instagram%3A%20,1%20year)). This means you get essentially 100% of the market volume and the true NBBO. The feed is consolidated and normalized by DataBento, with high precision timestamps. It supports **top-of-book quotes, trade ticks, and derived aggregates**. VWAP can be computed since every trade with size is available. *(Note: Earlier versions of DataBento had more limited exchange coverage, but the current service covers all U.S. equity exchanges ([Databento on Instagram: "We're trying to raise the bar in our industry ...](https://www.instagram.com/databento/p/DF75lO_tuON/#:~:text=Databento%20on%20Instagram%3A%20,1%20year)).)*
- **Historical Data:** **Included at no extra cost.** The $199 plan includes free access to historical data alongside live data ([Upcoming changes to pricing plans in January 2025 | Databento Blog](https://databento.com/blog/upcoming-changes-to-pricing-plans-in-january-2025#:~:text=New%20subscription%20plans)). DataBento offers deep history (e.g. **7+ years of tick history** for equities) ([Databento on Instagram: "We're trying to raise the bar in our industry ...](https://www.instagram.com/databento/p/DF75lO_tuON/#:~:text=Databento%20on%20Instagram%3A%20,1%20year)). You can query recent intraday data (last 30 days or more) and daily bars easily via the same API. This meets the need for 15-min candles or last 30 days of daily data.
- **Latency:** **Very low latency.** DataBento’s infrastructure is **co-located in exchange data centers** and designed for speed ([Databento | Market data APIs and solutions for every firm](https://databento.com/#:~:text=Databento%20,Customize%20and%20get%20instant%20pricing)). The platform is aiming to provide latency on par with direct feeds – suitable for algorithmic trading. In practice, latency should be comparable to or better than Polygon’s feed. DataBento claims 99.95% price accuracy and uses direct exchange feeds for data sourcing.
- **API Integration (Python):** DataBento is built with developers in mind. It offers both REST-like HTTP APIs and efficient binary streaming. There are **official libraries/SDKs** for Python and other languages. The API is modern, with straightforward endpoints for requesting historical data or opening live streams. A quant on Reddit noted DataBento has *“overall the best API, support, and value today. Very easy to use.”* ([Polygon. io, Intrinio, Alpaca, or Xignite : r/quant](https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/1fjbzlv/polygon_io_intrinio_alpaca_or_xignite/#:~:text=,Limited%20exchange%20coverage%20and%20history)). This should translate to quick integration in a Python environment (they provide examples and documentation).
- **Limitations:** DataBento is a relatively **new entrant** (as of 2024/2025) – it may not have the long track record of IQFeed or other incumbents. However, early feedback on data quality is positive, and the company is actively improving coverage. Support for other asset classes (futures, options) exists but equities coverage was the latest addition, so any initial kinks are presumably being ironed out. The **flat $199 price** is for non-display use by one user; if you needed to redistribute data or use it commercially with many users, higher-tier plans would apply. For the described use-case (personal/internal use tracking a handful of stocks), DataBento aligns **very well with the needs** – providing full real-time data and recent history in an easy-to-use package well under the $600 budget.

## Alpaca Market Data API
- **Pricing:** **Free for basic plan, $99/month for “Unlimited” plan.** Alpaca’s data API has two tiers ([Alpaca - Unlimited Access, Real-time Market Data API](https://alpaca.markets/data#:~:text=%240%2Fmo)):
  - The **Free plan ($0)** provides real-time data from the IEX exchange only ([Alpaca Support  - What data provider does Alpaca use?](https://alpaca.markets/support/data-provider-alpaca#:~:text=Alpaca%20uses%20IEX%20and%20SIP,market%20data%20to%20its%20users)). This has no cost but only covers ~2–3% of market volume (IEX) – see limitations below.
  - The **Unlimited plan ($99/month)** provides the *full SIP* consolidated feed (CTA and UTP feeds for NYSE, Nasdaq, AMEX, etc.) ([Alpaca Support  - What data provider does Alpaca use?](https://alpaca.markets/support/data-provider-alpaca#:~:text=The%20Free%20plan%20consists%20of,Investors%20Exchange%20LLC)). This gives 100% coverage of U.S. equities in real time. Alpaca does not charge additional exchange fees on top of the $99 for non-pro users. *(In the past, Alpaca offered this at a lower price or for free with certain accounts, but as of the current pricing it’s $99/mo for full market data.)*
- **Data & Features:** **Real-time trades and quotes via WebSockets and REST.** With the Unlimited plan, Alpaca streams consolidated quotes (NBBO) and all trade prints across Nasdaq, NYSE, AMEX, and other exchanges ([Alpaca Support  - What data provider does Alpaca use?](https://alpaca.markets/support/data-provider-alpaca#:~:text=The%20Free%20plan%20consists%20of,Investors%20Exchange%20LLC)). Essentially it replicates what Polygon’s stock feed offers – you get top-of-book bid/ask and last sale updates with similar latency, since Alpaca itself gets direct SIP feeds. Extended hours data is included as well (pre-market and post-market trading from ECNs). The free plan, by contrast, uses IEX-only data – which means you *do* get real-time updates, but only for trades occurring on IEX and quotes from IEX. This is significantly incomplete for most stocks (IEX contributes ~16% NBBO quotes and a small fraction of trades) ([Real-time Stock API for Nasdaq Market Data - Nasdaq Basic](https://intrinio.com/financial-market-data/nasdaq-basic#:~:text=How%20much%20volume%20is%20included,in%20Nasdaq%20Basic)).
- **Historical Data:** **Yes – up to 7+ years back** via API ([Alpaca - Unlimited Access, Real-time Market Data API](https://alpaca.markets/data#:~:text=Historical%20Data)). Alpaca’s Market Data v2 API allows querying historical bars (1min, 15min, 1day, etc.) and even tick-level data. For example, you can request the last 30 days of daily prices or intraday candles easily. Note that **for non-paid users**, historical data for SIP is delayed 15 minutes (per Alpaca’s policy) ([Alpaca - Unlimited Access, Real-time Market Data API](https://alpaca.markets/data#:~:text=,15%20min%20delayed%20for%20SIP)), whereas paid users get full historical with no delay. In practice, with the Unlimited plan you can pull recent intraday data with volume up to the last minute.
- **Latency:** **Moderate latency, suitable for most algotrading (not HFT).** Alpaca’s SIP feed will have similar latency to other consolidated feeds – likely tens of milliseconds from exchange to you. Alpaca is cloud-based; they note it’s not designed for ultra-HFT use, but rather normal automated trading ([Market Data Subscription | Documentation](https://hawkalpha.gitbook.io/what-is-hawkalpha/alpaca-broker/market-data-subscription#:~:text=pattern)). User experiences generally find Alpaca’s real-time feed to be on par with brokerage data. If using the free (IEX) feed, note that IEX itself introduces a 350 µs delay (“speed bump”), but the bigger issue is missing other venues, not raw latency. For most uses, the $99 feed’s latency will feel real-time just like Polygon or IB.
- **API Integration (Python):** **Very easy.** Alpaca offers a REST API and WebSocket for data, with official SDKs in Python (`alpaca-py` etc.) and a well-documented interface. Setting up a stream is straightforward – you authenticate and subscribe to ticker channels. The API design is modern JSON over WebSocket, which is simpler than IQFeed/ActiveTick. Many developers already use Alpaca’s API for trading, so it’s well-tested. There is a **30-symbol limit on websocket streaming for the free tier** ([Alpaca - Unlimited Access, Real-time Market Data API](https://alpaca.markets/data#:~:text=Websockets)), but that is lifted on the Unlimited plan (which allows unlimited symbols). Tracking 1–10 symbols is no problem in either case. Overall, Python integration is seamless – if you have an Alpaca brokerage account, you can use their data API with minimal code.
- **Limitations:** The main requirement is that you **need an Alpaca brokerage account** (even for data). Getting API keys entails creating a free account (US-regulated broker). This is fine for most users, but it does mean your use must comply with their terms (personal use of data tied to your account). For the **free plan (IEX data)**, the limitation is **incomplete coverage** – NBBO and VWAP calculations will *not* be accurate since you’re missing most trades (price discrepancies can occur, especially in fast markets or outside regular hours) ([Avoid Finnhub like the plague : r/algotrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/fyfpqp/avoid_finnhub_like_the_plague/#:~:text=1,when%20compared%20to%20other%20sources)). Essentially, IEX-only data is not sufficient for serious strategy tracking across Nasdaq/NYSE stocks ([Question on limitation with IEX only (free plan) on the Alpaca platform : r/algotrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/17ovh4u/question_on_limitation_with_iex_only_free_plan_on/#:~:text=IEX%20data%20only%20comes%20from,The%20data%20is%20very%20sparse)). The **$99 plan** removes that issue, giving full market data. At $99, it’s cheaper than many other full feeds, but note that it’s intended for use with Alpaca’s trading platform. If you only need data and have no interest in Alpaca’s brokerage, you are paying primarily for the data service. The API itself has no major limitations for 1–10 symbols; just be aware of standard rate limits (10,000 API calls/min on paid plan) which are generous ([Alpaca - Unlimited Access, Real-time Market Data API](https://alpaca.markets/data#:~:text=API%20Calls)). In summary, **Alpaca’s Unlimited data feed is an excellent Polygon alternative** if you don’t mind the brokerage sign-up – it’s affordable, easy to use, and provides the real-time data required.

## Tradier API (Brokerage w/ Data)
- **Pricing:** **No dedicated fee** – real-time market data is included for **free** with a Tradier brokerage account ([Market Data | Brokerage API Documentation | Tradier](https://documentation.tradier.com/brokerage-api/overview/market-data#:~:text=Realtime%20data%20is%20available%20to,with%20any%20realtime%20data%20solution)) ([Market Data | Brokerage API Documentation | Tradier](https://documentation.tradier.com/brokerage-api/overview/market-data#:~:text=)). Tradier’s business model is brokerage (with optional subscription for commission-free trading), so they provide streaming data to account holders at no extra cost. There is no way to purchase data alone; you must open an account (which has no minimum balance requirement). If you do active trading, Tradier charges either per trade or a $10/month flat fee for unlimited trades – but if you only use the data API and don’t trade, you could maintain a funded account with minimal balance and pay nothing for data.
- **Data & Features:** Tradier provides **consolidated U.S. equity data (SIP)** via its API. This includes **real-time quotes (bid/ask)** and **time & sales** for all securities on NYSE, Nasdaq, AMEX, etc., consolidated into NBBO ([Market Data | Brokerage API Documentation | Tradier](https://documentation.tradier.com/brokerage-api/overview/market-data#:~:text=)). In other words, you get the full market best bid/offer and trade prints, similar to Polygon or any SIP-based feed. The API supports **streaming quotes** over HTTP or WebSocket, and also **REST endpoints** for snapshots and historical data (including time and sales). For example, there’s an endpoint to get intraday trades (“timesales”) for a given symbol ([Market Data | Brokerage API Documentation | Tradier](https://documentation.tradier.com/brokerage-api/overview/market-data#:~:text=Get%20Get%20Quotes%20%20,53%20Get%20Lookup%20Symbol)). Tradier also covers options data if needed (chains, greeks, etc.), and provides market-wide info like movers and fundamentals. For the user’s needs (stocks on Nasdaq/NYSE/AMEX), Tradier will deliver all required real-time fields (last price, volume, bid, ask, etc.) with the same scope as Polygon’s feed.
- **Historical Data:** **Available via REST.** Tradier offers endpoints for historical daily prices and intraday time & sales. You can request up to a certain range (the API docs suggest you can get historical quote data via `GET /v1/markets/history` and intraday trades via `.../timesales`). The exact depth of history isn’t explicitly stated in their public docs, but users have been able to pull months of intraday data. At minimum, you can certainly get the **last 60 minutes of intraday ticks** (or any intraday window for the current day) and recent days of data for computing VWAP or other stats. For daily data, Tradier likely has many years (since they partner with a data provider on the back-end). If extensive history is needed, one might use another source for that; but for the “last 30 days” requirement, Tradier should suffice via multiple API calls or one call with range.
- **Latency:** **Comparable to other retail broker feeds.** Tradier’s data is pulled from a consolidated feed (the same SIP that everyone uses) ([Market Data | Brokerage API Documentation | Tradier](https://documentation.tradier.com/brokerage-api/overview/market-data#:~:text=)). The latency is on the order of milliseconds to a few hundred milliseconds from the exchange. Tradier’s servers are cloud-based; anecdotal reports from users indicate the streaming data is real-time for practical purposes (no intentional delay beyond SIP). It’s not an ultra-low-latency direct feed, but it’s similar to Interactive Brokers or Polygon in speed. For 1–10 symbols, the throughput is low and the data should stream promptly. One consideration: Tradier’s streaming API uses HTTP chunked transfer or WebSockets, which adds a tiny overhead, but it’s still real-time. In summary, latency is **sufficiently low** that for general algorithmic trading or tracking, you won’t notice a lag.
- **API Integration (Python):** **Easy-to-use REST and streaming API.** Tradier’s API is modern and developer-friendly. You authenticate with an OAuth token. For streaming, you first hit a “create session” endpoint and then connect to a provided URL for live data ([How to stream realtime quotes | Brokerage API Documentation](https://documentation.tradier.com/brokerage-api/streaming/post-markets-events#:~:text=How%20to%20stream%20realtime%20quotes,connect%20to%20a%20streaming)). They support both HTTP Streaming and WebSocket streaming, so you can choose. Python integration can be done with the requests library for REST or `websockets`/`websocket-client` for the stream. There are also community wrappers (and even an official sample client) since Tradier has been around for a while. The documentation is thorough, with examples for quotes, historical data, etc. ([Market Data | Brokerage API Documentation | Tradier](https://documentation.tradier.com/brokerage-api/overview/market-data#:~:text=Fetch%20quotes%2C%20chains%20and%20historical,via%20REST%20and%20streaming%20APIs)) ([Market Data | Brokerage API Documentation | Tradier](https://documentation.tradier.com/brokerage-api/overview/market-data#:~:text=)). Most developers find the Tradier API straightforward; for instance, getting a quote or time&sales in JSON is one GET request. Overall, hooking this into a Python app is relatively quick. 
- **Limitations:** You must maintain a **Tradier brokerage account** – the API is intended for Tradier customers. While there’s no additional cost for data, using the API for commercial purposes or distributing the data would violate terms. It’s meant for personal trading/investment use. Another limitation is that Tradier, being a broker API, has call rate limits (e.g. 120 calls per minute for some endpoints) and may not be designed for pulling massive historical data in one go. For the scale in question (a few symbols, moderate history), this is not a problem. Also note that Tradier’s focus is U.S. markets; if you needed non-US stocks, you’d need another provider. In terms of reliability, some users have noted occasional interruptions in the HTTP stream that require reconnecting (as is common with long-lived HTTP streams). But generally, it’s stable. Tradier is a great **no-cost solution for real-time stock data** if you’re comfortable using a brokerage API and keeping an account open. It aligns well with the needs (full real-time data, Python-friendly, and well under budget).

## ActiveTick MarketData API
- **Pricing:** **$59.95/month (Basic)** or **$99.95/month (Professional)** ([
	ActiveTick MarketFeed Pricing - by ActiveTick
](https://www.activetick.com/PricingMarketFeed.aspx#:~:text=ActiveTick%20MarketFeed)) ([
	ActiveTick MarketFeed Pricing - by ActiveTick
](https://www.activetick.com/PricingMarketFeed.aspx#:~:text=%2499)), plus exchange fees. The **Basic plan** allows up to 500 streaming symbols and provides real-time data (trades/quotes) for stocks, options, and currencies, along with “historical chart data” API access ([
	ActiveTick MarketFeed Pricing - by ActiveTick
](https://www.activetick.com/PricingMarketFeed.aspx#:~:text=,Access%20to%20ActiveTick%20Platform)). The **Professional plan** increases to 2,000 symbols and adds access to historical tick-level data and Level II/order book data ([
	ActiveTick MarketFeed Pricing - by ActiveTick
](https://www.activetick.com/PricingMarketFeed.aspx#:~:text=,Contract%20Definition%20API)). For most users with 1–10 symbols, the Basic tier is sufficient for real-time and basic historical needs. Exchange fees are not included, so you’d pay the SIP fees (likely a few dollars total for non-pro). Even with those, the cost stays well below $600 (around ~$65–$105/mo total).
- **Data & Features:** **Full market coverage (consolidated) with some quality caveats.** ActiveTick is a licensed data vendor with direct connections to exchanges ([
	ActiveTick MarketFeed Pricing - by ActiveTick
](https://www.activetick.com/PricingMarketFeed.aspx#:~:text=Our%20Data)). It provides **real-time Level 1 data**: trade ticks, best bid/ask quotes, and even option quotes. The feed covers all U.S. equities exchanges, so in theory you get complete time and sales and NBBO. ActiveTick also offers a range of APIs (including an **option chain API, market movers API, Level II feed** with the Pro plan, etc.) ([
	ActiveTick MarketFeed Pricing - by ActiveTick
](https://www.activetick.com/PricingMarketFeed.aspx#:~:text=,Contract%20Definition%20API)). However, it’s important to note that **user experiences with ActiveTick’s data quality have been mixed**. Some have reported missing ticks or other anomalies. In a comparison from a few years ago, ActiveTick’s data quality was described as “poor” relative to competitors ([IQFeed vs Polygon.io | Elite Trader](https://www.elitetrader.com/et/threads/iqfeed-vs-polygon-io.320799/#:~:text=,Support%20is%20good)) – it had issues like gaps in historical data and less reliability. They have a smaller user base and fewer public reviews than Polygon or IQFeed, so due diligence is warranted. For core real-time stock quotes and trades, ActiveTick does function, but it may not be as polished (e.g. corporate actions might not be handled as cleanly).
- **Historical Data:** **Included, but with potential throttling.** The Basic plan touts a “historical chart data API,” which typically means you can retrieve historical time series (likely intraday bars and daily data). The Professional plan explicitly includes a **historical tick data API** ([
	ActiveTick MarketFeed Pricing - by ActiveTick
](https://www.activetick.com/PricingMarketFeed.aspx#:~:text=,Contract%20Definition%20API)), which implies you can request tick-by-tick history for past days (they advertise ~7+ years of tick history available) ([IQFeed vs Polygon.io | Elite Trader](https://www.elitetrader.com/et/threads/iqfeed-vs-polygon-io.320799/#:~:text=,Support%20is%20good)). However, users have noted that **historical data is throttled** – large queries may be slow or limited. If you only need, say, last 30 days of 15-min bars or last 60 minutes of ticks, ActiveTick can provide that; just be prepared for the API’s rate limits on history. The data should include volume, so you can compute VWAP from historical intraday if needed. In summary, ActiveTick meets the basic historical requirements, but it’s not as convenient or extensive as some others (you might need the higher plan for full tick history access).
- **Latency:** **Reasonably low, but not the fastest.** ActiveTick’s servers are not as widely distributed; the feed is delivered via their own infrastructure. While it is real-time, some users aiming for very fast data found ActiveTick a bit lagging. It’s unlikely to be noticeably different from Polygon for 1–10 symbols in a normal setting, but for ultra-fast needs it might not keep up. Also, any instability in their feed could introduce delays. Given that **cost is lower**, you might be trading off some performance. Still, ActiveTick is used by budget-conscious traders and generally considered **“great value if you are on a budget” despite its issues ([IQFeed vs Polygon.io | Elite Trader](https://www.elitetrader.com/et/threads/iqfeed-vs-polygon-io.320799/#:~:text=,Support%20is%20good))**. For non-HFT use, it should be acceptable.
- **API Integration (Python):** **More complex than RESTful APIs.** ActiveTick provides multiple ways to access data:
  - A **MarketFeed SDK** (with libraries for C++, .NET, Java) for streaming data – this is a low-level socket API.
  - A **REST API** for certain requests (snapshots, history). In fact, ActiveTick’s site mentions a REST interface for ease of integration ([
	ActiveTick MarketFeed Pricing - by ActiveTick
](https://www.activetick.com/PricingMarketFeed.aspx#:~:text=,About)).
  - No first-party Python SDK, so you’d either use the REST endpoints from Python or write Python bindings for their socket API. The **ActiveTick API has a reputation for being a bit of a “pain” to work with** ([IQFeed vs Polygon.io | Elite Trader](https://www.elitetrader.com/et/threads/iqfeed-vs-polygon-io.320799/#:~:text=,Support%20is%20good)), especially the streaming via SDK. It’s not as straightforward as JSON over WebSocket. If you only need a few symbols, one approach is to use the REST API to poll for updates or get snapshots periodically, but that sacrifices true real-time streaming. Alternatively, one could run their C++ SDK and push data to Python. This is doable, but definitely more involved than using Alpaca or Tradier. Also, **support** from ActiveTick is reported to be minimal ([IQFeed vs Polygon.io | Elite Trader](https://www.elitetrader.com/et/threads/iqfeed-vs-polygon-io.320799/#:~:text=,Support%20is%20good)), so if you run into integration issues, you may have to solve them largely on your own or via community forums.
- **Limitations:** The key limitation is **data quality and support**. ActiveTick’s low price comes with trade-offs: users have noted missing or incorrect data points at times, and the company’s support and documentation aren’t as robust as competitors ([IQFeed vs Polygon.io | Elite Trader](https://www.elitetrader.com/et/threads/iqfeed-vs-polygon-io.320799/#:~:text=,Support%20is%20good)). If your application can tolerate the occasional glitch or you’re mainly focused on a small number of highly liquid symbols (where issues might be less frequent), it could work. But if data accuracy and continuity are paramount, you might lean toward slightly more expensive options like IQFeed or DataBento which are known for quality. Another limitation is that ActiveTick’s **web-based console and community** are not very active, meaning less shared code or examples for Python. In short, ActiveTick is a **budget solution**: it will give you real-time NBBO and trades for U.S. stocks at a low monthly cost and with long history, but be prepared for a less developer-friendly experience and some potential need to validate/clean the data.

## Other API Solutions to Consider
- **Finnhub:** A freemium financial data API. Finnhub’s *free tier* provides real-time US stock prices, but **only from the IEX exchange** ([Avoid Finnhub like the plague : r/algotrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/fyfpqp/avoid_finnhub_like_the_plague/#:~:text=1,when%20compared%20to%20other%20sources)). This means free users get a limited view (which can lead to price differences from the true market, especially during busy periods or off-hours). Finnhub does offer **premium plans (starting around $49.99 up to ~$199.99/month)** that increase the number of API calls and possibly include better data. For full market real-time stock data, Finnhub has a **“US SIP” feed offering** (i.e. consolidated tape) aimed at enterprise/startup clients, but pricing is not publicly listed – some sources indicate it could be in the few hundred dollars a month range. The Finnhub API itself is quite easy to use (REST endpoints and a WebSocket for live trades). They also provide many other datasets (news, fundamentals, global markets). However, **there have been community complaints** about data accuracy and support responsiveness for Finnhub. For example, some users accused Finnhub of having inconsistent data or copying other APIs, though Finnhub has disputed those claims ([Avoid Finnhub like the plague : r/algotrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/fyfpqp/avoid_finnhub_like_the_plague/#:~:text=1,when%20compared%20to%20other%20sources)). **Bottom line:** Finnhub can be an option if you need a general financial data API. If using the free tier, it’s similar to Tiingo/IEX (not full coverage). If considering the paid tier for full SIP, ensure to get clarity on what is included. It could meet the requirements, but given the uncertainty, other providers may be preferable for reliable real-time trade/quote feeds.
- **Intrinio:** Intrinio is a data platform that offers various feeds. Relevant here are:
  - **Nasdaq Basic real-time stock prices** – a feed that provides **bid, ask, and last sale data for all US-listed stocks at a lower cost** than SIP by only using Nasdaq-sourced data. Nasdaq Basic typically reflects ~16% of total equity volume (Nasdaq’s share) ([Real-time Stock API for Nasdaq Market Data - Nasdaq Basic](https://intrinio.com/financial-market-data/nasdaq-basic#:~:text=How%20much%20volume%20is%20included,in%20Nasdaq%20Basic)). It is reasonably high-quality and *“drifts”* only slightly from true NBBO, but it is not the full NBBO especially during fast markets ([Real-time Stock API for Nasdaq Market Data - Nasdaq Basic](https://intrinio.com/financial-market-data/nasdaq-basic#:~:text=How%20much%20volume%20is%20included,in%20Nasdaq%20Basic)). Intrinio resells this as a product; to get both bids and asks in Basic, the underlying exchange fee is ~$2000/mo for an organization ([Real-time Stock API for Nasdaq Market Data - Nasdaq Basic](https://intrinio.com/financial-market-data/nasdaq-basic#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20exchange%20fees,for%20this%20feed)), but Intrinio might have individual plans that are cheaper (possibly a few hundred a month for developers – they encourage contacting for a quote). 
  - **15-min Delayed SIP feed (“Silver” package)** – Intrinio offers a very affordable package (~$500/mo + ~$250 in exchange fees) for **15-minute delayed** full market data ([SIP Data](https://intrinio.com/sip-data#:~:text=100%25%20full)). This is meant for app developers who need **full-depth historical and delayed data** without the exchange costs of real-time ([SIP Data](https://intrinio.com/sip-data#:~:text=Displaying%20quality%2C%20full,most%20affordable%20on%20the%20market)) ([SIP Data](https://intrinio.com/sip-data#:~:text=Just%20%24500%2Fm%20%2B%20%24250%20exchange,fees)). It includes 100% volume (all exchanges) but updates are delayed 15 minutes to avoid real-time fees.
  - **Real-time SIP feed (“Platinum” package)** – Intrinio does have a real-time SIP option for enterprise, but it’s priced in the thousands per month (likely not under $600).
  
  Intrinio’s APIs are developer-friendly (they have REST and WebSocket, and SDKs for Python). They also bundle a lot of data (fundamentals, news, etc.). **For the specific needs here**, Intrinio’s **Nasdaq Basic** could be a consideration if one is willing to accept partial market coverage in exchange for lower cost. It’s **more accurate than IEX-only data** because it includes Nasdaq’s quotations for NYSE-listed stocks too, giving at least one side of the NBBO most of the time ([Real-time Stock API for Nasdaq Market Data - Nasdaq Basic](https://intrinio.com/financial-market-data/nasdaq-basic#:~:text=Why%20would%20we%20want%20to,use%20Nasdaq%20Basic)). But since the user can pay up to $600 or more, it probably makes sense to get a full feed from one of the above instead of Basic. Intrinio’s **delayed SIP** feed is not real-time (15 min lag), so that fails the real-time requirement. Thus, while Intrinio is a reputable vendor, their affordable offerings either skip some portion of data or are delayed. They might be useful for historical data (they have 50+ years of end-of-day, etc.), but for real-time trading or live VWAP calculations, Intrinio wouldn’t be the top choice unless the budget was **extremely** constrained and a slight delay or partial data was acceptable.
- **IEX Cloud / Tiingo:** These are worth mentioning as ultra-low-cost options if **only a small subset of data is needed**. **IEX Cloud** (by the IEX exchange) and **Tiingo** both can provide real-time stock quotes with no exchange fees by leveraging IEX’s own data. For example, Tiingo’s API offers a real-time feed from IEX for about **$10/month** ([Best service for real time streaming of stock data? : r/algotrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/me1298/best_service_for_real_time_streaming_of_stock_data/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)). Similarly, IEX Cloud has free/cheap tiers that give real-time prices, but again, **only from the IEX exchange**. These solutions effectively give you the IEX order book and trades, which is a *fraction* of the overall market. They might be sufficient for monitoring a few very liquid symbols as a rough guide, but you would not get an accurate NBBO or volume picture (especially for stocks that primarily trade on NYSE/Nasdaq). For instance, using IEX-only data could show a last price that is stale or a bid/ask that misses an active market on other exchanges ([Question on limitation with IEX only (free plan) on the Alpaca platform : r/algotrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/17ovh4u/question_on_limitation_with_iex_only_free_plan_on/#:~:text=IEX%20data%20only%20comes%20from,The%20data%20is%20very%20sparse)). **VWAP calculations** on IEX-only data would not match the true market VWAP. The upside is these APIs are extremely simple (JSON REST calls) and basically free or very cheap. However, given the user’s willingness to pay for quality data, these are generally not suitable except perhaps as backup data sources. They were more relevant when Polygon’s full feed was expensive and some just needed any real-time feed. Today, with options like Alpaca at $99 or DataBento at $199, it makes sense to get the *full* market data if you need accuracy. In summary, IEX Cloud/Tiingo are **low-budget alternatives with significant coverage limitations** – fine for basic apps or experimentation, but not recommended if you require comprehensive real-time stock data for Nasdaq, NYSE, and AMEX stocks.
- **Other providers:** There are a few other niche or enterprise providers. **dxFeed** (by DevExperts) is an institutional feed that’s been described as a “better version of Polygon” ([Polygon. io, Intrinio, Alpaca, or Xignite : r/quant](https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/1fjbzlv/polygon_io_intrinio_alpaca_or_xignite/#:~:text=,version%20of%20Polygon)) – it powers platforms like TradingView. They have started offering self-service data subscriptions for individuals, but pricing is not clearly public (likely on par with Polygon’s $200/mo range or higher). **Barchart** offers a suite of data APIs (historical and real-time) under a usage-based model; a real-time feed from them might end up ~$100–$300+ depending on usage, but you’d need to contact for specifics. **Quandl/Nasdaq Data Link** provides a lot of historical data (some via APIs), but not low-latency real-time feeds. **Bloomberg BPIPE/Refinitiv**, etc., are well beyond the budget (costing thousands per month). **Interactive Brokers (IB)** deserves a note: if the user already has IB’s Gateway API, they technically have access to real-time data by subscribing to IB’s market data (which is ~$10/mo for U.S. stock bundle). IB’s API will stream quotes and trades for subscribed symbols. The reason many still seek alternatives is that IB imposes a max update rate (messages are conflated to ~≤5 Hz for most equity data) and some pacing limits. IB is fantastic for trading execution, but for capturing every tick or building custom intraday bars, its data can be incomplete. Still, for completeness: IB’s solution is **by far the cheapest** (just exchange fee cost) and integrates in Python via `ib_insync` easily, but it wasn’t listed as a primary alternative likely because of those data throttling limitations.
  
Each alternative comes with trade-offs. **In summary**, for a budget up to $600, the **best alignment with the user’s needs** would likely be **DataBento or IQFeed** (dedicated data feeds with full market coverage and solid history) or, if the user prefers a simpler setup, **Alpaca or Tradier’s API** (leveraging broker-provided data at much lower cost, with slight differences in ease/latency). DataBento at $199/mo offers a very attractive combination of full depth, long history, and modern API – it’s arguably a direct Polygon competitor on quality. IQFeed, while a bit old-school in API, is a **proven reliable feed** widely used in trading ([Polygon. io, Intrinio, Alpaca, or Xignite : r/quant](https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/1fjbzlv/polygon_io_intrinio_alpaca_or_xignite/#:~:text=has%20this%20problem,but%20it%20follows%20a%20pattern)). Alpaca’s $99 feed is a great value if one is okay using their trading API ecosystem. Tradier is essentially free and also quite developer-friendly for a broker API, making it a hidden gem for real-time data if cost is a major concern. 

Ultimately, the choice might come down to how much weight is put on **ease of integration vs. independence** (broker vs. independent feed) and on **data quality vs. cost**. The good news is that all these options come in under the specified budget and can deliver the required real-time stock data, so it’s about selecting the solution that best fits the workflow and reliability needs.
